1.	What is JWT?
JSON Web Tokens is the standard by which developers use to create self-contained tokens. These would be used to securely transmit information between applications and services. It is used for authentication and authorization.  (Descope, 2024)

2.	Why is it essential for secure web applications?
It is vital to secure web applications as it reduces the organizations’ vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of an attack. It protects the users and the organisation. (Patil, n.d.)

3.	How does JWT work with HTTP headers?
HTTP headers are used for authentication. When clients access protected information, a JWT is sent in the HTTP request. This request is then to the sever where it is verified using the JWT’s secret key. If the token is found to be valid, then the information will be sent to the user.  (Frontegg, 2023)

4.	Find 1 real-world example of a breach
In February of 2025, a red team was able to find a weak point in a SaaS provider’s architecture. Attackers would have been able to exploit the weak KWT validation and the subdomain misconfigurations to gain access to the system and take over any admin accounts.  (Arafat, 2025)
